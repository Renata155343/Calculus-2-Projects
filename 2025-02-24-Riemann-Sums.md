# Riemann Sums
The unique function I chose for this project was $$e^x$$. I modeled it in Mathmatica by editing the template function for a left riemann sum to include my function, and then plotted it with various n values to show how the accurracy increased as more rectangles were created.  
After creating my graph, I uploaded it to BambuStudio and increased it's size to reasonable proportions.  
Then, after downloading Fusion 360, I designed the base with slits to hold my function inserts. I also imbedded the name of my function onto the base for increased identification and clarity.  

Here is my function modeled with left Riemann sums in Bambu:

And here is my base modeled in Fusion:
