# 3D Printed Sphere
This was my first 3D printing project.
### The task was to:
- Create a sphere in BambuStudio
- Ensure your sphere had a unique radius from the rest of the class
- Ensure your sphere location on the print plate was unique from the rest of the class

I used a template of someone's previously-made sphere on Bambu, though I later learned that such rudimentary shapes can also be made from scratch on Bambu.\
I then modified the length of my sphere to be 15mm across and notified my classmates of my size selection.\
After slicing and exporting the file, I sent it to a classmate who combined all the student spheres into a singular file. 

Here is an image of my final sphere:
