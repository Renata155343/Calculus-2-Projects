# Complementary Coffee Cups
I chose the function $$x^2$$ with a range from 0 to 1. The task was to find a line $$x=k$$ so that when my function was revolved around the y-axis and $$x=k$$, the volumes would be equal. 
I first found the volume when my function revolved around the y-axis, and then I calculated the volume for the second revolution and solved for k.  
**Here are my calculations:**

After determining that $$k=4/3$$, I graphed my function in Desmos and uploaded the line to Fusion.

Once in Fusion, I rotated the segment, hollowed the shapes, and added handles to create mugs.  
**Here is the mug rotated around the y-axis:**

Both of these cups fit together and hold the same amount of liquid.
